Issues:


NEED TO TAKE A BREAK AND WORK ON MY JS SKILLS AND INTERVIEW SKILLS!
- add categories! (defined by user and then used to sort/filter between tats in his list.
- next stage: websockets!
 * messages (general and topic specific)
 * following users (?)
 * number of times profile was seen
 * private messages

profile page ideas:
- been a member since..
- likes (?)
- number of tattoos saved
- profile picture (add yours or choose from sets). also add random picture option.
- stats?
- contact us/me (user writes his own)
- bio ( user writes his own)
   will include:
 * details on user/artist
 * contact info
 * ...
 * how many tattoos they have

Design ideas:
- non straight lines
- categories: side bar with colors. on hover shows the name. add minimize    button

Further ideas:
- get images from "actual" artists and make this a website who connects between artists and clients. 
- add the artists images and ask a user to mention if he went through with the tattoo or a similliar one.
- add notifications on the user dropdown. red bubble tothe left of the profile image
